# ``CosmicWorks.Models`` models library

CosmicWorks is an open source set of tools and libraries to generate data quickly for your proof of concept or sample applications.

## Overview

Contains model classes for various items created by other CosmicWorks tools.

> ðŸ’¡ The **CosmicWorks** sample data is partially derived from [AdventureWorksLT](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works).
